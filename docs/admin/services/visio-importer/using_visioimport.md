# Using the Visio importer

## Prerequisites
- Configured service in Symbio Web
- Storage GUID token (generated during the service configuration)
- In the visio file(s): All shapes that need to be imported are connected properly (for example supplementary text)
- In the visio file(s): All shapes have an associated master shape

## Usage

Note: This is incomplete/abandoned for the time being. The on-page help will be up-to-date.

First select the visio (.vsdx) file you want to import or drag and drop it into the highlighted area. If you add multiple files to the queue they will be processed all at once.

At the mapping screen, click on one of the round buttons to start drawing a connection. Click on one of the round buttons on the other side to connect a Visio with a Symbio element. Dragging is not required.

BPMN Gateways from the BPMN stencilset do not need to be explicitly mapped, the types 'and', 'or' and 'xor' will be assigned automatically during the import. All other Gateways need to be explicitly mapped.

When you are finished, submit the mapping and you will be shown a preview of the process generated by viz-js (to be replaced by the layouter service in the future).

The following page will ask you for the storage token. When submitting it the service starts the import of your visio file and will notify you on completion.
